## An Analysis of NHL Coaching & Team Statistics

The datasets used for this project were derived from the Professional Hockey Database from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/professional-hockey-database).   
This data, originally sourced from The Hockey Database from Open Source Sports, is a collection of historical statistics from men's professional hockey teams in North America from 1917 until 2011. Although there were 20 datasets within the source, only 6 were utilized (masters, coaches, awardCoaches, teams, teamsPost, and abbrev). Masters includes the names and biographical information for all players and coaches involved in the North American Hockey, coaches includes coaching statistics, awardCoaches includes coaches awards, trophies, and postseason all-star teams, teams includes team regular season statistics, teamsPost includes team post-season statistics, and abbrev includes abbreviations used in Teams and SeriesPost tables.  

Using these datasets, we were able to answer the following research questions for the NHL:  
```markdown
- How does the team performance change after the coach wins the Jack Adams award?    
- How does the team performance change after winning a Stanley Cup?    
- What coach coached the same team for the longest number of years?     
- What coach won the most Stanley Cups?     
- What coach had the best full regular season (in terms of number of points per season)?     
- Is there any correlation between regular season and post-season performance?      
- Are there any coaching tactics that consistently result in a good record?  High PKC / GA (Defensively oriented) or High PPG / GF (Offensively oriented)? (PKC = Penalty Kill Chances, GA = goals against, PPG = power play goals, GF = goals for)      
```

It is important to highlight that the points system in hockey is as follows: a win is worth 2 points, an overtime loss is worth 1 point, and a straight loss is worth 0 points. Furthermore, the modern NHL playoff (based off of the team with the most amount of points in their division at the end of the regular season, plus wild cards from each conference) structure started in 1988. Lastly, in 2004, the NHL experienced a lockout and had no games as a result.
